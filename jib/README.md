# Data-Structures and Algorithms To Implement for Edification

## Data-Structures
 - LinkedList
   - LinkedList(), insert(), remove(), iterable
   - Unit tested but never really used
   - Add some pretty printing (todo)
 - TreeNode
   - n-ary super-class inherits from Graph
   - TreeNode(), add() **in progress**
   - Enforce tree non-cyclic constraints (todo)
   - Binary sub-class (todo)
 - Trie
 - GraphNode
   - Directed
   - GraphNode(), add, remove
   - Bidirectional (todo)
   - Make it iterable (todo)
 - Heap
 - Vector / ArrayList
   - Use this collection in GraphNode (todo)
 - Hash table
 - Stack
 - Queue

## Algorithms
 - Breadth-First Search
 - Depth-First Search
 - Binary Search
 - Merge Sort
 - Quick Sort
